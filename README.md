# Linux server from zero to ~~hero~~ feet-on-desk-happy admin
**Create your very own fun virtual private server**

## What is this repository about

I like having fun. Everyone loves having fun. I have fun when playing with linux and when I create stuff like websites, webapps, webservices, VPN, chat bots, IoT devices and so on.
If you are like me, you will get quickly bored when all your amazing work is caged in lab environment behind ISP router. I want others to see my stuff! I want to access my stuff from anywhere in the world.
One day, my dream came true, as I have encountered amazing offer. I could buy a domain for 1€/yr and I could rent a small VPS also for 1€/mo. That's a deal I couldn't pass on!

Since then, I have spent countless weeks of reading about stuff I can make on my server and then applying it to my server.
I have since then also rebuilt whole server from basic template to fully functioning system multiple times.

I have started with Ubuntu server 14.04LTS, then transitioned to 16.04LTS and currently I am prepearing for yet another start-from-scratch on Ubuntu 18.04LTS server. I very much recommend Ubuntu server for any noob like me, as it is very forgiving and easily learnable system.

Every time I build the system from naked server, I try to make it most up-to-date, secure, following best practices and trends as possible. I also very much try to learn from my mistakes and make it better every time.

Since I do this sereral times a year, I have been forced to create documentation/transcript with command I use and basic description on what I do.

It would be probably mean to keep them to myself forever, so I decided to tidy my notes and share them for others to use!

Obviously you cannot add scripts and stuff I have on my personal server, but you can always suggest better practices or correcting my mistakes, as I am and always will be learning new stuff and I would love to hear opinions from other people. Because let's face it, there is never enough sources for such complex things like Linux and everything that runs on it!
